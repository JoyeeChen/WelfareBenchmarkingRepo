      "I’m the watershed manager for Cedar Ridge Township, and we’ve just discovered a newly constructed beaver dam spanning the width of Maple Creek. Over the past month, the backed-up water has risen nearly two feet, flooding a low-lying section of county road, encroaching on adjacent hayfields, and threatening a culvert that provides the town’s only upstream access. With spring thaw and seasonal storms approaching, I need to decide how to proceed before emergency repairs become hundreds of thousands of dollars. What technical, regulatory, and long-term monitoring considerations should I factor in to restore proper flow and protect infrastructure—without triggering new permitting hurdles or causing unintended impacts downstream?
